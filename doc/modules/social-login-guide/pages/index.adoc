= Social Login

Jmix offers a comprehensive security subsystem that includes user management features out of the box. This built-in functionality allows developers to implement a variety of authentication methods while also providing the flexibility to integrate custom solutions. Among these options, Jmix supports integration with third-party services, such as LDAP/Active Directory servers and OpenID Connect providers.

One notable feature is the ability to implement Social Login, which enables users to authenticate using their existing accounts from popular platforms like GitHub, Facebook, and Google. This approach not only streamlines the registration process for users but also simplifies user management for developers and administrators.

Most Social Login services operate using widely adopted protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect, ensuring secure and efficient authentication. This guide will walk you through the steps to implement Social Login in your Jmix applications.

[TIP]
====
For applications that need to integrate with standards-compliant services or on-premises software like Keycloak, consider also using the xref:oidc:index.adoc[OpenID Connect add-on] for your Jmix project.

== What We Are Going to Build

This guide outlines the process of enhancing an application created using the standard *Full-Stack Application (Java)* template to support authentication via Google OpenID Connect and GitHub OAuth, alongside the default database-hosted accounts.

Users will have the flexibility to select their preferred authentication method directly from the login screen.

== Configure Authentication Providers

To enable authentication with a 3rd party service you will have to register Client ID and Client Secret in that service.

[TIP]
====
Never expose your Client Secret in client-side code or public repositories.
====

[[github-oauth]]
=== GitHub OAuth

. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps[Developer Settings^] page of your GitHub profile.

.. Sign in to your GitHub account.

.. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select *Settings* from the dropdown menu.

.. In the left sidebar, scroll down to *Developer settings* and click it.

.. On the *Developer settings* page, click on *OAuth Apps*.

. Create a new OAuth App

.. Click on the *New OAuth App* button to start configuring a new application.

.. Fill in the registration form with the following details:

* *Application name*: Choose a name that represents your application.

* *Homepage URL*: Enter `++http://localhost:8080++` if you are running the app locally, or provide the actual application's base URL if it’s hosted on a server.

* *Authorization callback URL*: Use `++http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github++` if running locally. Replace `++http://localhost:8080++` with the actual application's base URL if it’s hosted on a server.

.. Click *Register application*.

. Generate Client Secret

.. In the newly created app settings, click the *Generate a new client secret* button.

.. Copy both the `Client ID` and `Client secret` that were generated. These credentials will be required to configure OAuth for your application.

. Securely store the `Client ID` and `Client secret` in a safe location, as you’ll need them for integrating GitHub OAuth authentication with your application.

[[google-openid]]
=== Google OpenID

. Open https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console^] and sign in with your Google account if you aren’t already logged in.

. Create a New Project

.. In the *Authorized redirect URIs* section, add the following URI: `++http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google++`. Replace `++http://localhost:8080++` with your app’s actual base URL if it is hosted on a server.

. Generate the Client ID and Client Secret

.. Click *Create* to finish.

.. A dialog box will appear displaying the `Client ID` and `Client secret`. Copy these credentials as they are essential for configuring OpenID authentication in your application.

[[configure-application-project]]
== Configure Application Project

Specify client ids and secrets in the project’s `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
.application.properties
----
include::example$src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=credentials]
----

Add Spring Boot OAuth2 client starter to the `build.gradle` dependencies section:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::example$build.gradle[tags=dependencies]
----

[[extend-user-entity]]
== Extend User Entity

In order to be compatible with Spring Security OAuth2 API, the `User` entity should implement the `org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser` interface.

Add it to the list of interfaces implemented by `User`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/entity/User.java[tags=user;oidc-user]
----

The `OidcUser` methods are not used in the application, so you can leave their implementations empty.

The next step is to add an attribute that will indicate what service authenticates this user: built-in application security, Google or GitHub.

Create an `AuthenticationType` enumeration:

[source, java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/entity/AuthenticationType.java[]
----

Then add the `authenticationType` attribute to the `User` entity:

[source, java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/entity/User.java[tags=user;auth-type]
----

[[configure-oauth2-login]]
== Configure OAuth2 Login

To customize OAuth 2.0 Login provided by Spring Security, you need to create a security configuration class. It should extend the `FlowuiVaadinWebSecurity` class defined in Jmix and be annotated with `@EnableWebSecurity`:

[source,java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----

The `UnconstrainedDataManager` bean should be used instead of the `DataManager` to allow the configuration code to access the `User` entity without any restrictions.

Let's take a closer look at the different parts of the configuration.

The `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method is an entry point to the security settings configuration. It defines the OAuth2 login process by setting the login page, handling user data from the authentication provider, and managing the post-login behavior:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=configure]
----

The `onAuthenticationSuccess()` method handles successful authentication. It redirects users to the main view after successful login:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=onAuthenticationSuccess]
----

The `oauth2UserService()` and `oidcUserService()` methods are responsible for mapping user information returned by the authentication service to your application’s `User` entity.

The `oidcUserService()` method handles GitHub users:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=oauth2UserService]
----

The `oidcUserService()` method handles Google users:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=oidcUserService]
----

Both methods depend on the `loadUserByUsername()` function that loads a user by username from the database or creates a new user if the user does not exist:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=loadUserByUsername]
----

The `username` attribute of the `User` entity will store identifiers returned by the authentication services.

The `getDefaultGrantedAuthorities()` method creates a list of authorities to be assigned to the authenticated user. For demonstration purposes, the `getDefaultGrantedAuthorities()` method assigns full access rights. In a real-world application, however, it is essential to assign more limited privileges to new users. At minimum, new registrations should be assigned a `ui-minimal` role, as well as user-specific roles that provide access to relevant business entities, attributes, views, and menu items.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/security/OAuth2SecurityConfiguration.java[tags=getDefaultGrantedAuthorities]
----

[modify-login-view]
== Modify Login View

Open `login-view.xml` descriptor and add login buttons below the `loginForm` element:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/resources/com/company/sociallogin/view/login/login-view.xml[tags=social]
----

The button click handlers should redirect to URLs corresponding to the authentication providers:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/com/company/sociallogin/view/login/LoginView.java[tags=social]
----

Add some styling to `/frontend/themes/sample-social-login/sample-social-login.css` file to have nice looking social login buttons:

[source,css]
----
include::example$src/main/frontend/themes/sample-social-login/sample-social-login.css[]
----

This must be enough to test the implemented authentication methods. Run the application and open http://localhost:8080[^] in the incognito browser tab.
